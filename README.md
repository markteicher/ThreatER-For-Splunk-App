# 🛡️ ThreatER for Splunk App

## 🌐 Overview

ThreatER is a preemptive cybersecurity platform that builds trusted networks by automatically blocking known malicious traffic (IPs, domains) at the network edge, reducing noise for security teams and improving the efficiency of existing security tools (firewalls, SIEMs).

ThreatER acts as a foundational security layer by ingesting threat intelligence from multiple commercial, open-source, and government feeds and proactively filtering malicious activity **before it reaches internal systems**. It protects against both inbound and outbound threats with minimal latency, delivering an automated “set it and forget it” defense model.

The ThreatER for Splunk App brings this intelligence and enforcement visibility directly into Splunk, enabling security teams to **monitor, analyze, audit, and operationalize ThreatER activity** without relying solely on the ThreatER Portal UI.

## 🧠 How ThreatER Works

- **📡 Threat Intelligence Collection**  
  Aggregates data from commercial, open-source, and government threat feeds.

- **🚫 Proactive Blocking**  
  Blocks known malicious IPs and domains at line speed at the network layer (Layer 2/3), before traffic reaches firewalls or downstream controls.

- **🔗 Security Stack Integration**  
  Integrates with existing firewalls, EDR, SIEM, and security platforms to reduce alert noise and improve detection quality.

- **⚙️ Automation**  
  Automatically enforces blocking policies based on threat intelligence, transforming reactive security into proactive defense.

## ⭐ Key Benefits

- **🔕 Reduces Problem Space**  
  Eliminates known-bad traffic, dramatically reducing alert volume.

- **🧰 Enhances Existing Security Controls**  
  Feeds cleaner data into SIEMs, firewalls, and EDR platforms.

- **⚡ Real-Time & Scalable**  
  Enforces blocking instantly at scale without impacting network performance.

- **🤝 Builds Trusted Networks**  
  Establishes a baseline of trusted activity by removing known threats at the network edge.
